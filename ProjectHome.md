pascal4neko is a translation of the neko CFFI to object pascal.
With pascal4neko you can create .ndll (neko dlls) written in object pascal (Delphi or freepascal) which can be used in neko programs.
Alternatively you can use pascal4neko to embed neko modules in your pascal programs.
There is a sample webserver written in pascal (based on synapse and visualsynapse), which emulates mod\_neko. It can be used as a starting point for an application-server.
